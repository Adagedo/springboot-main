Before Following this project, please make sure you have a solid foundation of java.

## ðŸŒ± What is Spring MVC?

**Spring MVC** is a module of the Spring Framework that provides a robust Model-View-Controller architecture. It helps in building web applications in a clean, organized, and maintainable way.

- **Model** â€“ Represents the data and business logic.
- **View** â€“ Handles the presentation (e.g., HTML, Thymeleaf) what the users see.
- **Controller** â€“ Handles user input and updates the model.

## Now, why spring mvc???

Clean separation of concerns

Built-in form handling and validation

Easy to extend and integrate with other Spring modules

## ðŸš€ Key Features

âœ… Annotation-based controllers (`@Controller`, `@GetMapping`, etc.)  
âœ… View resolvers for rendering HTML or JSON  
âœ… Dependency injection and easy testing  
âœ… Configurable via `application.properties` or `application.yml`

In simple term, the **controller** recives users request, interact with the **model** to get the request data and then tells the **views** what to display.
